# OMDb-WebServiceFilms

The OMDb API is a RESTful web service to obtain movie information, all content and images on the site are contributed and maintained by our users. 

If you find this [API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) useful, please consider making a [ONE-TIME-DONATION](https://www.paypal.me/FritzAPI) or become a [PATRON](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=5038490).

--> The donations will be for the creator of the API, not for the creator of this application.

## Getting Started

The web is based on the OMDb API, which is free to use. The page is designed using bootstrap and using jQuery, js and others.

The main page presents the web, in the main bar we have the search bar with which we can find all kinds of movies. The banner is random, refresh the web to see what you're up to! And the photo carousel will show you some recommendations. Finally in the footer you will find useful information about the API, its creator and me, the developer of this website.

When you search for a movie you will look for anything related to it, series, documentary parodies and even videogames. Click on more details to know much more about it and animate to see it!

I hope you enjoy the web. If you find any error please contact me.
